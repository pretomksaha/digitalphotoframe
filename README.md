# Digital Photo Frame
This is a spring boot project to provide Digital Photo Frame and a simplest way of deploying Internet of Things (IoT) for smart home.This IoT project allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure.

# SUPPORTING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
The most basic tools are a source code editor and a compiler or interpreter, which are used ubiquitously and continuously. Other tools are used more or less depending on the language, development methodology, and individual engineer, and are often used for a discrete task, like a debugger or profiler. Here, I use
1. Spring Boots
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. JavaScript
5. Ajax

# PRINCIPLES OF PROJECT
Here I have worked for automation of digital photo frame for smart home with the help of IoT device and two sensor. As a matter of fact, I tried to include two case in my project with the help of this two sensor. 

The cases are Human exist in the room (Motion Sensor): In the room a motion sensor will be installed and configured with the Digital photo frame. Then motion sensor will identify the presence of human in the room. If the sensor find any movement, then it detect and send the message to the digital photo frame through the IoT. As a result, the digital photo frame start to show the sliding of photos

Identify friends and family persons (Face Detection Sensor): I try to implement a new feature for Digital Photo frame by using face detection sensor. This sensor will help to show the pictures of the family and friends who will be present in the room at that time.
